  <p>Click links or polygons tto view racial restrictions in property deeds across Connecticut in the 1930s-40s. Some suburban developers prohibited occupants â€œother than the white race" or "other than the Caucasian race." The U.S. Supreme Court initially approved these racial barriers in the 1926 Corrigan v. Buckley ruling, but later declared them unenforceable in the 1948 Shelley v. Kraemer decision. Evidene of these racial barriers still exist in town property records, but a 2021 Connecticut law made it easier for owners to renounce them. To date, researchers have been found racial restrictions in West Hartford (by Katie Campbell); Newington and Manchester (by David K. Ware); and Hamden (by June Gold).
