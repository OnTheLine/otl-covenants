  <p>Click on colored polygons to view racially restrictive covenants in the Hartford area in the 1940s. Real estate developers wrote restrictions into property deeds that prohibited occupants â€œother than the white race" or "other than the Caucasian race." The U.S. Supreme Court approved these restrictions in the 1926 Corrigan v. Buckley ruling, but later declared them unenforceable in the 1948 Shelley v. Kraemer decision. Yet these restrictions still exist in official property records. To date, these covenants have been found in suburban developments in West Hartford (by researcher Katie Campbell, Trinity College) and Manchester and Newington (by researcher David K. Ware, <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3546228">see his UConn Law paper</a>). If you know of similar restrictions, by race or religion, anywhere in Connecticut, <a href="http://ontheline.trincoll.edu">contact the author</a>.
