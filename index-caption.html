  <p>Click links or polygons to view Connecticut neighborhoods where most or all properties include racist covenants by housing developers to prohibit occupants "other than the white race." Although the US Supreme Court declared racial covenants unenforceable in 1948, and the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968 made them unlawful in 1968, only in 2021 did Connecticut pass a law to make it easier for current owners to reject this language in official town land records. If you know about a property with similar restrictions, by race or religion, anywhere in Connecticut, <a href="http://ontheline.trincoll.edu">contact the authors</a>.
