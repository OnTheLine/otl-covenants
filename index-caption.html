  <p>Click links or polygons to view racist restrictions in property deeds across Connecticut in the 1930s-40s, where suburban developers prohibited occupants "other than the white race" or "other than the Caucasian race," until the US Supreme Court declared these unenforceable in 1948. While the racist language still exists in town property records, a 2021 Connecticut law made it easier for current owners to legally remove it, without erasing it from our historical memory. To date, researchers have found racial covenants in the CT towns of West Hartford (by Katie Campbell); Newington and Manchester (by David K. Ware); and Hamden (by June Gold).
