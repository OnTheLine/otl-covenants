## moodus lake shores notes

Dave

I'm going to send you individual emails about each of the five East Haddam places for which we don't currently have maps, as I get time to work on them while away for the next week.

For Moodus Lake Shores, here's a Google Map of the general area

My understanding is that you counted 407 plots on the town clerk's map

Here is your list of roads from the town clerk's map
	Paula Road
	Berry Road
	Pine Road
	Rock Road
	Birch Road
	Steven Road
	Mabel Road
	Hilltop Road
	Short Road
	Beach Road
	Oak Road
	Hilltop Road Extension
	Gramma Lane
	Lorraine Road

Your list is very similar, but not identical, to the current list of roads on the Town of East Haddam website for Lake Associations

MOODUS LAKE SHORES
(Upper Moodus Reservoir)
BEACH ROAD
BERRY ROAD
BIRCH ROAD
BRITAIN ROAD
CAMP ROAD
EMILY ROAD
GERONIMO ROAD
GRAMA ROAD
HILLTOP ROAD
MABEL ROAD
MAPLE ROAD
OAK ROAD
PAULA ROAD
PINE ROAD
ROCK ROAD
SHADY ROAD
SHORT ROAD
STEVEN ROAD
SWAMP ROAD
TOM ROAD
WARD ROAD

Attached is an image of a continuous boundary that I can drawn around the current list of roads (which I presume is very similar to your 1940s list of roads, which some additions over time)

However, there appear to be only 50-60 present-day structures inside this boundary.

If the 1940s developer created 400+ plots, but only 50-60 structures exist today, it's unclear to me how we should "count" this, since table I've created from our suburban town research says uses the phrase "Estimated homes restricted"

Thoughts?
